Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

    THe Driverpass project consisted of designing a system for the client DriverPass which needed to be able to manage driving lessons, appointments, and the different course materials. The hope was to design a more efficient system to help raise the grades of student drivers through a more user friendly experience.

What did you do particularly well?

    Some parts that I believe that I did particularly well were the amount of detail I tried to put into the different diagram, as well as maping out the different system designs.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    If I could choose one part to revise, I would go back and clarify the use cases more, I feel like I could have gone into more specific user scenarios.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    I interpreted the user's needs by analyzing how they interacted with the other users, such as customers to admins. I implemented the needs into my system design by bring features like user authentification and online payments.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    One technique that helps when approaching the software design is by creating different system models such as use case diagrams or activity diagrams as these help to show the different relations and workflows.
